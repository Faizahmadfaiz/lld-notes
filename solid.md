Here’s a summarized version of everything we’ve discussed from the beginning till now, with key points you can use to revise before your interview:

SOLID Principles Revision

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

	•	Definition: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
	•	Key Points:
	•	Ensures classes are more focused and easier to maintain.
	•	Violations occur when a class handles multiple concerns, e.g., business logic and database operations.
	•	Example: A Report class that both generates a report and sends it via email violates SRP. Refactor by separating report generation and email sending responsibilities into different classes.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

	•	Definition: A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
	•	Key Points:
	•	You should be able to add new functionality by extending classes rather than modifying existing ones.
	•	Commonly implemented using abstractions like interfaces or abstract classes.
	•	Example: A PaymentGateway interface can have different implementations (CreditCard, Paypal) without modifying the existing payment logic.

Advanced Example:

	•	Scenario: A DiscountCalculator class that applies discounts based on customer types (VIP, regular) should not be modified when new discount rules are added.
	•	Solution:
	•	Use a Strategy Pattern: Define a DiscountStrategy interface and implement different strategies (VIPDiscount, RegularDiscount, etc.).
	•	Use a Rule-based approach: Define a DiscountRule interface and check multiple rules in sequence (e.g., SaleDiscount, VIPDiscount).

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

	•	Definition: Subclasses should be replaceable with their base classes without affecting the correctness of the program.
	•	Key Points:
	•	If a subclass violates the expectations set by the base class, it violates LSP.
	•	Example: A Penguin class that inherits from Bird and cannot fly violates LSP. Solution: Introduce a FlyingBehaviour interface that only flying birds implement.

Advanced Example:

	•	Scenario: You have different types of employees (hourly, salaried, commissioned) and need to calculate salaries.
	•	Solution:
	•	Use an abstract base class Employee with a calculateSalary() method and have subclasses (HourlyEmployee, SalariedEmployee, CommissionedEmployee) implement it. This ensures LSP is followed.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

	•	Definition: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use.
	•	Key Points:
	•	Instead of large, monolithic interfaces, split them into smaller, specific ones.
	•	Example: If a Worker interface has methods work(), eat(), and sleep(), a Robot class implementing this interface shouldn’t be forced to implement eat() or sleep() methods. Solution: Split into separate Workable, Eatable, and Sleepable interfaces.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

	•	Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
	•	Key Points:
	•	Avoid tight coupling between high-level and low-level modules.
	•	Introduce interfaces or use Dependency Injection to decouple dependencies.
	•	Example: A NotificationSystem should depend on a Notification interface, with implementations like EmailNotification and SMSNotification, instead of directly depending on concrete classes.

Advanced Example:

	•	Legacy Code: In a system that doesn’t support interfaces, use the Factory Pattern or configuration-based approach to decouple dependencies. For example, a ReportGenerator class that depends on PDFGenerator can be refactored to use a factory that returns different generators (PDFGenerator, CSVGenerator, etc.).

Advanced Scenario-based Questions

Scenario 1: Open/Closed Principle and New Requirements

Problem: The company wants to add a 20% discount for orders over $500 without modifying the existing DiscountCalculator logic.

Solutions:

	•	Strategy Pattern:
	•	Define a DiscountStrategy interface and implement separate strategies for VIP, Regular, and Sale discounts.
	•	Example usage:

DiscountCalculator calculator = new DiscountCalculator(new SaleDiscountStrategy());
calculator.calculateDiscount(order);


	•	Rule-based Approach:
	•	Define a DiscountRule interface. Each rule (VIPDiscountRule, SaleDiscountRule, etc.) checks if it applies and calculates the discount.
	•	Example:

List<DiscountRule> rules = Arrays.asList(new SaleDiscountRule(), new VIPDiscountRule());
DiscountCalculator calculator = new DiscountCalculator(rules);



Scenario 2: Dependency Inversion Principle in Legacy Code

Problem: The ReportGenerator class is tightly coupled to PDFGenerator, and you need to extend it to support CSV reports without changing the existing code.

Solution:

	•	Use a Factory Pattern or configuration-based approach to return the appropriate generator based on the report type. This decouples ReportGenerator from specific implementations and follows DIP.

Scenario 3: Conflict Between OCP and LSP

Problem: You have an Employee class with subclasses for hourly, salaried, and commissioned employees. You need to extend it to add more employee types while ensuring OCP and LSP are respected.

Solution:

	•	Use an abstract Employee class with a calculateSalary() method. Subclasses like HourlyEmployee, SalariedEmployee, and CommissionedEmployee each implement their own salary logic.
	•	New employee types can be added without modifying the base class, ensuring OCP. Subclasses replace the base class correctly, ensuring LSP.

Key Points for SOLID Principles in Interviews:

	1.	Understand real-world scenarios: Be prepared to explain how each principle applies in real-world problems.
	2.	Identify violations: Practice identifying where code violates SOLID principles and suggest ways to fix them.
	3.	Explain trade-offs: Understand that in legacy systems or under certain constraints, you may have to make compromises, especially in adhering to all principles.
	4.	Patterns for SOLID: Know how common design patterns (Strategy, Factory, Dependency Injection) help achieve SOLID principles.
	5.	Code clarity: Ensure your solutions make the codebase more maintainable, extensible, and flexible.

This summary encapsulates our entire discussion and provides you with a quick reference for each principle, along with real-world examples and advanced scenarios. Review this before your interviews, and you’ll be well-prepared!
