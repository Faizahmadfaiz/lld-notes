Builder Pattern Overview:

	•	Definition: The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing for step-by-step object creation with optional parameters. This is useful when there are many optional parameters or construction steps that result in a complex object.
	•	Use Cases:
	•	When you want to avoid constructor telescoping (i.e., multiple constructors with varying numbers of parameters).
	•	When the object creation process involves multiple optional parameters or complex configuration.
	•	When immutability is preferred, as builders often allow constructing an immutable object.
	•	Comparison with Other Patterns:
	•	Factory Pattern: Focuses on abstracting the object creation process, often returning different subtypes of a common interface or superclass.
	•	Prototype Pattern: Involves cloning existing instances to avoid costly initialization when creating a new object.

Core Components of the Builder Pattern:

	1.	Builder Class: Contains all possible fields to construct the target object and includes methods (often named setX()) to configure these fields.
	2.	Fluent API Design: Methods return the Builder instance itself to allow method chaining.
	3.	Build Method: The build() method returns the final object after setting the appropriate fields.
	4.	Private Constructor: The target class (e.g., Pizza, Computer) typically has a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation and enforce object creation via the builder.

Builder Pattern Example:

Pizza Example:

class Pizza {
    private Dough dough;
    private Cheese cheese;
    private Sauce sauce;
    // other fields...

    private Pizza() {}

    public static Builder builder() {
        return new Builder();
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private Dough dough;
        private Cheese cheese;
        private Sauce sauce;

        public Builder setDough(Dough dough) {
            this.dough = dough;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setCheese(Cheese cheese) {
            this.cheese = cheese;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setSauce(Sauce sauce) {
            this.sauce = sauce;
            return this;
        }

        public Pizza build() {
            Pizza pizza = new Pizza();
            pizza.dough = this.dough;
            pizza.cheese = this.cheese;
            pizza.sauce = this.sauce;
            return pizza;
        }
    }
}

// Usage:
Pizza pizza = Pizza.builder().setDough(new Dough()).setSauce(new Sauce()).build();

	•	Key Points:
	•	The Pizza class has a private constructor, ensuring the object is created only via the builder.
	•	The builder class provides methods for setting optional components (setDough, setCheese, etc.).
	•	The builder pattern avoids constructor telescoping and allows flexible creation of Pizza objects with various configurations.

Feedback on Code and Best Practices:

	•	Method Chaining: Ensure builder methods return this to support method chaining.
	•	Static Builder Method: Use a static builder() method to provide access to the Builder class.
	•	Encapsulation: Keep fields in the target class (Pizza, Computer) private and avoid setters to enforce immutability.
	•	Field Assignments: In the build() method, assign values directly to fields in the target object, not through setters (since there are none in an immutable object).

Computer Example (Builder Pattern Refactoring):

Refactored code for a Computer class:

class Computer {
    private String CPU;
    private String RAM;
    private String storage;
    private String GPU;

    private Computer() {}

    public static Builder builder() {
        return new Builder();
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private String CPU;
        private String RAM;
        private String storage;
        private String GPU;

        public Builder setCPU(String CPU) {
            this.CPU = CPU;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setRAM(String RAM) {
            this.RAM = RAM;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setStorage(String storage) {
            this.storage = storage;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setGPU(String GPU) {
            this.GPU = GPU;
            return this;
        }

        public Computer build() {
            Computer computer = new Computer();
            computer.CPU = this.CPU;
            computer.RAM = this.RAM;
            computer.storage = this.storage;
            computer.GPU = this.GPU;
            return computer;
        }
    }
}

// Usage:
Computer computer = Computer.builder()
    .setCPU("Intel i7")
    .setRAM("16GB")
    .setStorage("512GB SSD")
    .build();

Scenario-Based Design:

SDK Client Configuration Example:
Imagine you are building an SDK for a third-party service where developers need to configure optional settings such as timeout, retries, and baseURL. Each of these settings is optional, and different developers might configure different combinations. Using the Builder Pattern would allow developers to configure only the options they need while keeping the code flexible.

class APIClient {
    private int timeout;
    private int retries;
    private String baseURL;

    private APIClient() {}

    public static Builder builder() {
        return new Builder();
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private int timeout;
        private int retries;
        private String baseURL;

        public Builder setTimeout(int timeout) {
            this.timeout = timeout;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setRetries(int retries) {
            this.retries = retries;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setBaseURL(String baseURL) {
            this.baseURL = baseURL;
            return this;
        }

        public APIClient build() {
            APIClient client = new APIClient();
            client.timeout = this.timeout;
            client.retries = this.retries;
            client.baseURL = this.baseURL;
            return client;
        }
    }
}

// Usage:
APIClient client = APIClient.builder()
    .setTimeout(5000)
    .setRetries(3)
    .setBaseURL("https://api.example.com")
    .build();

Key Points:

	•	Developers can choose which fields they want to configure (timeout, retries, baseURL), while the rest can remain default.
	•	The Builder Pattern provides a clean and flexible API for setting optional parameters.
