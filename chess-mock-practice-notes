Chess Game: Low-Level Design Summary

1. Core Class Structure and Relationships

Main Classes

	•	GameEngine: Manages the overall game flow, turn switching, move validation, and state updates.
	•	Board: Represents the 8x8 chess board and contains Cell objects.
	•	Cell: Each cell holds information about its row, column, and potentially an occupying Piece.
	•	Piece (Abstract Class): Represents a chess piece and defines common properties (e.g., color, alive status). Each piece type (King, Queen, Rook, etc.) is a subclass.
	•	Player: Represents a player (either Human or AI) with attributes like name, color, and the ability to make moves.
	•	Move: Holds details of a single move, such as the start and end cells, the piece moved, and any piece captured.

Key Relationships

	•	Composition:
	•	Board contains multiple Cell objects.
	•	Cell may contain a Piece.
	•	Inheritance:
	•	Piece is extended by specific piece types (e.g., King, Queen).
	•	Player is extended by specific player types (HumanPlayer, AIPlayer).
	•	Association:
	•	GameEngine has references to Board, Player[], and MoveManager.

2. Design Patterns and Their Application

Strategy Pattern for Move Validation

	•	Problem: Each piece has unique movement rules.
	•	Solution: Use a PieceStrategy interface with implementations for each piece type (e.g., KingStrategy, QueenStrategy).
	•	Factory Method: PieceStrategyFactory returns the appropriate strategy for each piece, ensuring modular and flexible move validation.

Observer Pattern for Real-Time Game Updates

	•	Problem: Notify players of the updated game state after each move.
	•	Solution: GameEngine (subject) notifies Player (observers) whenever the game state changes. Each player’s notify method updates their view of the board.

Factory Method Pattern for Special Moves

	•	Problem: Moves like castling, en passant, and promotion require special handling.
	•	Solution: SpecialMoveStrategy interface with separate classes like CastlingStrategy, EnPassantStrategy, and PromotionStrategy for each special move. MoveManager uses getSpecialMoveStrategy to delegate to the right strategy.

3. Key Functionalities and Implementation Details

Move Validation Process

	•	Regular Moves: Validate using the piece’s PieceStrategy, ensuring adherence to movement rules.
	•	Special Moves:
	•	Handled by specialized strategies. For instance:
	•	Castling: Ensures the king and rook haven’t moved, no pieces are in between, and the cells are not under attack.
	•	Pawn Promotion: Allows the player to choose a piece upon reaching the opposite end of the board.

Undo and Redo Functionality

	•	Undo Stack: Maintains a stack of previous moves (movesPlayed), allowing the game state to be reverted one step back.
	•	Multiple Undos: Using BoardSnapshot to store the board’s state at each move, allowing multiple undos by reverting to saved snapshots.
	•	Redo Stack (Optional): Maintains moves undone so players can redo moves if needed.

Error Handling for Invalid Moves

	•	Custom Exceptions:
	•	InvalidMoveException, OutOfTurnException, PieceNotFoundException for specific error cases.
	•	Centralized Validation:
	•	MoveManager validates moves and throws exceptions for invalid conditions.
	•	Graceful Error Handling:
	•	GameEngine catches exceptions and provides appropriate feedback to players, making gameplay smooth and user-friendly.

4. Real-Time and Multiplayer Considerations

Turn-Based Control and Concurrency

	•	Turn Validation:
	•	GameEngine checks currentPlayer to ensure only the player whose turn it is can move.
	•	Concurrency Control:
	•	For server-based implementations, synchronize move actions or use atomic transactions to handle simultaneous move attempts.
	•	WebSocket for Real-Time Updates:
	•	Use WebSocket connections to broadcast board updates to both players after each move.

Handling Player Disconnections

	•	Grace Period:
	•	If a player disconnects, a grace period is given for reconnection.
	•	Timeout and Forfeit:
	•	If the player doesn’t reconnect within the allowed time, they may forfeit the game, or the game can end in a draw if agreed upon.

5. Data Persistence and Replay Support

Database Schema

	1.	Games Table:
	•	Stores high-level details for each game (game_id, player IDs, start and end times, status).
	2.	Moves Table:
	•	Records each move with game_id, move details (start and end position, piece moved, piece captured), timestamp, and special move indicators.

Efficient Replay and History Tracking

	•	Indexing: Index on game_id and move_number in Moves table for fast retrieval.
	•	Caching: Use Redis or in-memory storage for frequently accessed games.
	•	Bulk Retrieval for Replay: Query all moves in sequence for a given game_id, allowing a smooth replay experience.

6. Additional Enhancements

Edge Cases and Exception Handling

	•	Edge Case Handling: Validate moves for scenarios like blocked paths, checking the king’s safety, and game-ending conditions (stalemate, checkmate).
	•	Exception Logging: Log unexpected exceptions and errors to monitor issues during gameplay.

Extending Player Types

	•	Flexible Player Types:
	•	Player could be extended for AI players with different difficulty levels (e.g., BeginnerAIPlayer, AdvancedAIPlayer).
	•	Player customization allows variations in behavior or assistance (e.g., hints for beginners).

Summary and Final Notes

The design balances modularity, extensibility, and simplicity. We used key design patterns (Strategy, Observer, Factory Method) to handle complex chess logic efficiently and ensure a smooth player experience. The structure supports both basic gameplay and more advanced requirements, like multiplayer synchronization, replay, undo functionality, and edge case handling.

This design is flexible enough to accommodate additional features (e.g., player stats, custom AI logic) with minimal disruption to the core functionality, making it a solid foundation for a robust and scalable chess application.
