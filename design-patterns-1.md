Here are the full notes for today’s session, including all key points of discussion:

Design Patterns Covered: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Observer

1. Singleton Pattern

	•	Purpose: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
	•	Key Concepts:
	•	Lazy Initialization: The instance is created only when it is needed.
	•	Thread Safety: Use double-checked locking with synchronized and volatile to ensure thread-safe lazy initialization.
	•	Code Example:

class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}


	•	Use Cases: Centralized logging system, configuration managers, connection pools, caching systems.

2. Factory Method Pattern

	•	Purpose: Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling by delegating the instantiation logic to the factory classes.
	•	Key Concepts:
	•	Abstract Factory Interface: Each concrete factory class creates a different type of object.
	•	Extensibility: New product types can be added by creating new factory classes without modifying existing code.
	•	Code Example:

interface UserAccountFactory {
    Account create();
}

class AdminAccountFactory implements UserAccountFactory {
    public Account create() {
        return new AdminAccount();
    }
}

class RegularAccountFactory implements UserAccountFactory {
    public Account create() {
        return new RegularAccount();
    }
}


	•	Use Cases: When the instantiation process involves complex logic or requires different types of objects based on input (e.g., creating different types of users, vehicles, payment gateways).

3. Abstract Factory Pattern

	•	Purpose: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It’s useful when you need to ensure that a set of objects is compatible with each other.
	•	Key Concepts:
	•	Factory of Factories: The Abstract Factory pattern groups multiple factory methods under a single interface.
	•	Family of Products: Used to create families of products that are meant to be used together (e.g., a UI toolkit that supports both Mac and Windows components).
	•	Code Example:

// Abstract Product Interfaces
interface Button {
    void paint();
}

interface Checkbox {
    void render();
}

// Concrete Products for Windows
class WindowsButton implements Button {
    public void paint() {
        System.out.println("Rendering a Windows button.");
    }
}

class WindowsCheckbox implements Checkbox {
    public void render() {
        System.out.println("Rendering a Windows checkbox.");
    }
}

// Concrete Products for MacOS
class MacButton implements Button {
    public void paint() {
        System.out.println("Rendering a Mac button.");
    }
}

class MacCheckbox implements Checkbox {
    public void render() {
        System.out.println("Rendering a Mac checkbox.");
    }
}

// Abstract Factory Interface
interface GUIFactory {
    Button createButton();
    Checkbox createCheckbox();
}

// Concrete Factories for each product family
class WindowsFactory implements GUIFactory {
    public Button createButton() {
        return new WindowsButton();
    }

    public Checkbox createCheckbox() {
        return new WindowsCheckbox();
    }
}

class MacFactory implements GUIFactory {
    public Button createButton() {
        return new MacButton();
    }

    public Checkbox createCheckbox() {
        return new MacCheckbox();
    }
}


	•	Use Cases: Cross-platform UI toolkits, creating families of objects that must work together, dependency injection frameworks.

4. Observer Pattern

	•	Purpose: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.
	•	Key Concepts:
	•	Subject Class: Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of state changes.
	•	Observer Interface: The observers implement this interface to receive updates from the subject.
	•	Decoupling: The observer pattern decouples the subject from the observer, promoting flexibility and maintainability.
	•	Code Example:

interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void detach(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers(String message) {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(message);
        }
    }
}

class EmailObserver implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println("Email sent: " + message);
    }
}

class SMSObserver implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println("SMS sent: " + message);
    }
}

class PushNotificationObserver implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println("Push notification sent: " + message);
    }
}


	•	Use Cases: Event handling systems, messaging services, notification systems (e.g., notifying followers when a user posts on social media).

5. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) in Design Patterns

	•	Purpose: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to extend the functionality of a system without modifying existing code.
	•	Violation Example (Observer):
	•	The original observer code could violate OCP by requiring modification when adding new notification types. Introducing interfaces or separating notification logic via the strategy pattern ensures that you can add new notification types without modifying existing classes.
	•	Simple Refactor for OCP Compliance:

class SlackObserver implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println("Slack message sent: " + message);
    }
}


	•	Key Point: The Open/Closed Principle ensures that your system is extensible without requiring changes to existing code, especially when adding new behaviors.

Key Takeaways from the Session:

	1.	Singleton Pattern:
	•	You have a strong understanding of lazy initialization and thread safety in Singleton patterns.
	•	Double-checked locking and volatile are critical for handling Singleton creation in multi-threaded environments.
	2.	Factory Method Pattern:
	•	You correctly applied the Factory Method pattern for creating different account types (Admin, Guest, Regular).
	•	Your design promotes extensibility, allowing new account types to be added easily.
	3.	Abstract Factory Pattern:
	•	You understood that the Abstract Factory pattern is best for creating families of related objects, such as cross-platform UI components.
	•	This pattern ensures compatibility between products created by the same factory, promoting consistency across product families.
	4.	Observer Pattern:
	•	You grasp the fundamentals of the Observer pattern, especially in situations where a subject needs to notify multiple observers.
	•	We discussed the Open/Closed Principle in the context of the Observer pattern, ensuring that new observer types can be added without modifying existing classes.

Final Thoughts:

	•	Your understanding of the Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, and Observer patterns is solid. You’ve demonstrated flexibility in applying these patterns to different scenarios and refined your solutions based on feedback.
	•	You are well-prepared for FAANG-level design pattern questions, especially when combining these patterns with SOLID principles.
