Notes on Parking Lot System Design

Below is a comprehensive summary of our discussion on designing a parking lot system, along with feedback to help you prepare for your interviews. The notes are structured according to the key topics we covered, with detailed insights on areas that need improvement.

1. Vehicle Types and Spot Assignment

Summary:

	•	Initial Approach:
	•	The system accommodates different vehicle types: motorcycles, cars, and buses.

	•	Implement automatic vehicle detection to enhance efficiency and reduce human error.
	•	Use a mapping mechanism to associate vehicle types with spot types.
	•	Enum Usage:
	•	Use enums for defining constants only, as per your preference.
	•	Keep the system flexible for future enhancements.

2. Scalability and Efficiency

Summary:

	•	Initial Approach:
	•	Iterating through all parking spots to find an available one, which is inefficient for large parking lots.
